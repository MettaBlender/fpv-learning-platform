      With the onboard dampening box, the gyros run perfectly on 32k loop time. The NXT also comes with 2 different BECs and 6 UARTs.
      The RXSR-FC (OMNINXT F7) supports 3-6s Lipo direct input, built-in BEC for camera / VTX and Power Filter.
      This FC is designed to be able to pair with 4in1 ESCs to form a powerful combo, and also has pins for individual ESCs.`,

      Featuring an 8 layer high current density board with twice the market average on-board capacitance,
      the ESC is built to withstand the harshest punishment of everyday FPV flying while delivering buttery-smooth flight
      characteristics paired with face-melting acceleration. By focusing on thermal dissipation from the ground up,
      the flight stack achieves excellent power to weight density without the need of heavy heat sinks.
      A close collaboration with AM32 allowed us to squeeze the last bit of performance without breaking the bank.`,
